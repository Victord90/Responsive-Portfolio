        <p>Hello my name is Victor I am 29 years old and have lived in central Florida my entire life.
           I have been in the hospitaliy industry my entire working career. I have recently decided to
           make a change and enrolled in a coding boot camp in the UCF Continued Education department.
           I am new to this but am determined and excited to have a new career in web development.
        </p>

       <p>
           I am a pretty simple guy, I love sports, Im a big Orlando Magic fan especially.
           I also love to cook, my favorite thing to do is to attempt a new recipe I've never
           tried before and make it my own delicious meal. I also love music and collect vinyl
           records, I have about 40 records so far. One of may favorite things to do on my
           day off is to go see a movie, I have a movie pass so why not get the most out of
           it.
       </p>

       <p>
           I currently live with my girlfriend Madelyn, we live walking distance to 
           Sea World which is nice when we want to get out the house and walk around
           to see the animals. We are the parent of two cats, Cheeto and Kanye they 
           are very friendly and sweet.
       </p>
